# üõ£Ô∏è AI Fundamentals Roadmap

**1. Understanding Artificial Intelligence**

* **What is AI?** Defining AI, its different types (narrow, general, super), and core concepts.
* **Problem Types AI Solves:** Classification, regression, clustering, recommendation, etc.
* **History of AI:**  Key milestones and breakthroughs.
* **AI Hardware Requirements:** Processors for AI, AI as a Service (AIaaS)

**2. Mathematics for AI**
* **Linear Algebra:** Vectors, matrices, linear transformations. Essential for manipulating data and understanding model weights.
* **Calculus:**  Derivatives, gradients, optimization (crucial for training ML models).
* **Probability and Statistics:** Distributions, statistical concepts (mean, variance, Bayes' Theorem) for data analysis and model uncertainty. 

**3. Machine Learning**
* **Supervised Learning:**  Algorithms learning from labeled data (e.g., classification, regression).
    * Linear Regression: Often a starting point. Learn how to model the relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables. This forms the basis for understanding more complex models. 
    * Logistic Regression: Despite the name, it's for classification problems (predicting categories: spam vs. not spam).
    * Decision Trees: Understand how a tree-like structure with branching decisions can be used for classification or regression.
    * Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
* **Unsupervised Learning:** Finding patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).
    * K-means Clustering   
    * Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* **Reinforcement Learning:** An agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties (like training a game-playing AI).
* **Overfitting and Underfitting:** Crucial concepts to diagnose if your model is too specific or too general. Know the signs and how to address them.
* **Model Evaluation:** Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves for performance assessment.

**4. Deep Learning**
* **Neural Networks:**  The foundation of deep learning, inspired by biological neurons.
* **Key Architectures:**
    * Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):  Superb for image processing.
    * Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Ideal for sequential data (text, time series). 
* **Backpropagation:**  Algorithm for training neural networks.
* **Libraries:**
    * TensorFlow
    * PyTorch

**5. Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
* **Text Processing:** Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization.
* **Representing Text:**  Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe).
* **Tasks:** Sentiment analysis, text classification, machine translation.

**6. Computer Vision (CV)**
* **Image Processing:** Filtering, resizing, transformations.
* **Object Detection:** Identifying objects and their locations within images.
* **Image Classification:** Assigning labels to images.

**7. Important Tools & Techniques**
1. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:** Real-world data is messy.  Learn techniques to handle missing data, outliers, and formatting issues.
2. **Feature Engineering:**  The art of transforming and creating features that improve your model's performance.
3. **Scikit-learn:** Mastering this Python library will give you access to a vast array of ML algorithms and tools.
4. **Gradient Descent:** An optimization algorithm common for training many ML models, understanding the basics gives insights into how models learn.
