# üõ£Ô∏è Specializing in AI Testing

## Data Quality and Preparation
* **Data bias:** Identifying and mitigating bias in datasets.
* **Data cleaning and preprocessing:**  Ensuring data is suitable for AI models.

## Model Evaluation & Metrics:
* **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score:**  Understanding when to use which metric.
* **ROC Curves, Confusion Matrices:** Visualizing model performance. 
* **Overfitting/Underfitting:**  Diagnosing and addressing these problems. 

## AI-Specific Testing Challenges
* **Explainability:** Testing the reasoning behind AI decisions.
* **Robustness:** Testing how models handle unexpected or adversarial inputs.
* **Fairness:** Ensuring AI systems don't perpetuate discrimination.
