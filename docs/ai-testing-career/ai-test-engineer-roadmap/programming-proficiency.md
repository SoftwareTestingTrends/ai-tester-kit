## Learning Python
### The Essential Foundations

1. **Variables:** Think of these as named containers for storing data.
   * Learn how to assign values using the `=` sign (e.g.,  `name = "Alice"`).

2. **Data Types:** The different kinds of data you'll work with:
   * **Numbers:**  (integers like 10, floating-point numbers like 3.14).
   * **Strings:** Text enclosed in quotes (e.g., "Hello, world!").
   * **Booleans:** True or False values.
   * **Lists:** Ordered collections of items (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, "apple"]`).
   * **Dictionaries:**  Store data in key-value pairs (e.g., `{"name": "Bob", "age": 30}`). 

3. **Operators:** Symbols that let you perform actions on data.
   * **Arithmetic**
   * **Comparison** 
   * **Logical**

4. **Conditional Statements:** Controlling the flow of your code.
   * `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for making decisions.

5. **Loops:** Repeating sections of code.
   * **`for` loops:** Iterating over items in a sequence (like a list).
   * **`while` loops:** Repeating code as long as a condition is true. 

6. **Functions:** Reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
   * Defining functions using the `def` keyword.
   * Passing arguments to functions.
   * Returning values from functions.

### Leveling Up

1. **Modules and Packages:** How to reuse code and leverage libraries created by others.
    * Importing built-in modules (like `math`, `random`)
    * Using external libraries through tools like `pip`.
2. **Setting up virtual environments:**
    * Understand why they are important (isolating project dependencies)
    * Using `venv` to create virtual environments
    * Using [The Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and setting up conda environments
    * Activating and deactivating environments
3. **Data Manipulation**
    * NumPy
    * Pandas

## Learning JavaScript

### Fundamentals

1. **Variables:** How to store data. Think of them as boxes to put your information in.
   * Understand `let`, `const`, and the older `var` for declaring variables.

2. **Data Types:** The different "flavors" of data you'll work with.
   * **Primitives:** Numbers, strings (text), booleans (true/false), null, undefined.
   * **Objects:** Collections of key-value pairs to store complex data.

3. **Operators:** Symbols that let you do stuff with your data.
   * **Arithmetic**
   * **Comparison** 
   * **Logical**

4. **Conditional Statements:**  Control the flow of your code based on decisions.
   * `if`, `else if`, `else`.

5. **Loops:** Automate repetitive tasks.
   * `for` loop (traditional counter-based loop).
   * `while` loop (keeps going until a condition is no longer true).

6. **Functions:** Reusable blocks of code that do specific tasks.
   * How to define a function using the `function` keyword.
   * Passing values into functions (parameters).
   * Returning values from functions. 

7. **The DOM (Document Object Model):** How your JavaScript code interacts with HTML elements on a webpage.
   * Selecting elements (e.g., `getElementById`, `querySelector`).
   * Modifying elements (changing text, styles, etc.).

8. **Events:** Things that happen on the webpage that you can respond to.
   * Understanding common events like 'click', 'mouseover', 'submit'.
   * How to add event listeners to elements.

9. **Asynchronous Programming:** Promises, async/await, essential for handling AI request/response cycles.

10. **Node.js:**  If you want to create server-side components for your AI projects or potentially run generative models locally.

11. **Frontend Frameworks (Optional but Highly Recommended):** Pick one to streamline your work:
    * React: Component-based, excellent for dynamic AI interfaces.
    * Vue.js: Approachable, great for smaller projects or prototypes.
    * Svelte: Newer, highly performant option.
