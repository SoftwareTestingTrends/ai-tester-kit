### The Essential Foundations
Learning basic Python will give you a solid foundational understanding of the language, which is essential for using packages and libraries effectively. Here's what you need to learn:
1. **Variables:** Think of these as named containers for storing data.
   * Learn how to assign values using the `=` sign (e.g.,  `name = "Alice"`).

2. **Data Types:** The different kinds of data you'll work with:
   * **Numbers:**  (integers like 10, floating-point numbers like 3.14).
   * **Strings:** Text enclosed in quotes (e.g., "Hello, world!").
   * **Booleans:** True or False values.
   * **Lists:** Ordered collections of items (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, "apple"]`).
   * **Dictionaries:**  Store data in key-value pairs (e.g., `{"name": "Bob", "age": 30}`). 

3. **Operators:** Symbols that let you perform actions on data.
   * **Arithmetic**
   * **Comparison** 
   * **Logical**

4. **Conditional Statements:** Controlling the flow of your code.
   * `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for making decisions.

5. **Loops:** Repeating sections of code.
   * **`for` loops:** Iterating over items in a sequence (like a list).
   * **`while` loops:** Repeating code as long as a condition is true. 

6. **Functions:** Reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
   * Defining functions using the `def` keyword.
   * Passing arguments to functions.
   * Returning values from functions.
7. **Modules and Packages:** How to reuse code and leverage libraries created by others.
    * Importing built-in modules (like `math`, `random`)
    * Using external libraries through tools like `pip`.
8. **Setting up virtual environments:**
    * Understand why they are important (isolating project dependencies)
    * Using `venv` to create virtual environments
    * Using [The Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and setting up conda environments
    * Activating and deactivating environments

### Leveling Up
1. **Manipulating Excel Sheets**
* `openpyxl` package
2. **Data Manipulation**
* Pandas is an essential toolbox for efficiently organizing and analyzing your data.
* Similar to how you organize data in spreadsheets like Excel or databases like SQL, Pandas enables effective structuring of your data.
* With Pandas, you gain access to a comprehensive set of analytical tools that streamline data cleaning, manipulation, and summarization. These tools also facilitate the calculation of crucial metrics, providing valuable insights from your data.
3. **Data Visualization**
* **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** These libraries create clear and informative charts and graphs (static visualizations) to help you understand your data.
* **Plotly:** Plotly allows you to build interactive charts and dashboards. You can zoom, click, and explore these visualizations in more detail.
4. **Machine Learning With Python** 
* **Scikit-learn:** This is a popular library for building, training, and evaluating machine learning models. It offers a wide range of algorithms for various tasks. 
* **Statsmodels:** This library provides tools for statistical analysis and model building. It's particularly useful for tasks involving classical statistical methods. 
* **TensorFlow:** This is a powerful framework widely used for developing deep learning models. It allows you to design and train complex neural networks for tasks like image recognition or natural language processing.  

### Practice Time
Use Python to build a data pipeline that processes, analyzes, and delivers insights from transactional data. The pipeline will:

* **Handle missing data:** This could involve filling in missing fields with appropriate values based on the data type (e.g., mean for numeric, mode for categorical).
* **Reshape and aggregate data:** This might involve summarizing the data by a specific dimension (e.g., daily sales figures) or calculating relevant metrics.
* **Calculate KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):** You can define specific metrics to assess performance based on your project's goals.
* **Generate insights:** Analyze the processed data to uncover trends or patterns and communicate meaningful findings.
* **Export results:** The data can be exported to a format suitable for sharing with stakeholders, such as an Excel spreadsheet.

This approach can be applied to various projects that involve transactional data, allowing you to gain valuable insights and inform decision-making.
