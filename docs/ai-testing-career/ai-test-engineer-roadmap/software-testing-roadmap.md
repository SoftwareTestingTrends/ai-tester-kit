# üõ£Ô∏è Software Testing Roadmap

**1. Core Concepts**

* **What is Software Testing?** Definition, goals (finding defects, ensuring quality, reducing risk), and its importance in software development.
* **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle):** Understanding how testing integrates at various stages (requirements, design, coding, etc.).
* **Verification vs. Validation:** Key differences and goals.
* **Test Levels:** Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing ‚Äì their purpose and focus at different stages.
* **Test Types:** 
    * Functional Testing: Black-box, white-box, grey-box techniques.
    * Non-Functional Testing: Performance, security, usability, compatibility, etc.

**2. Testing Methodologies**

* **Waterfall:** Traditional, sequential model.
* **Agile:** Iterative, flexible; how testing adapts.
* **DevOps:** Emphasizing testing integration in continuous development cycles.

**3. Test Planning and Design**

* **Test Strategy:**  High-level approach, types of testing, and risk management.
* **Test Plan:**  Detailed document outlining scope, schedule, resources.
* **Test Cases:**
    * Creating effective test cases covering requirements and scenarios.
    * Positive and negative test cases.
* **Black-Box Testing Techniques** (Here's where we delve deeper):
    * **Equivalence Partitioning:** Dividing the input domain into valid and invalid classes.
    * **Boundary Value Analysis:** Testing edge cases (minimum, maximum values, etc.) at input boundaries.
    * **Decision Table Testing:**  Structured approach combining inputs, conditions, and expected outputs.
    * **State Transition Testing:**  Testing system behavior across different states and state transitions.
    * **Error Guessing:**  Predicting and testing for potential errors based on experience.
    * **Use Case Testing:**  Deriving test cases from user workflows and use cases.

**4. Test Execution**

* **Manual Testing:** Executing test cases step-by-step without automation.
* **Test Environments:** Setting up appropriate environments for testing (dev, staging, production).
* **Bug Reporting:**  Clear, concise defect logging with relevant details.
* **Bug Tracking Tools:** Jira, Bugzilla, etc.

**5. Test Automation**

* **Introduction to Automation:** Benefits, trade-offs, when to automate.
* **Test Automation Tools:**  Selenium, Appium, Cypress, etc. - choosing the right fit.
* **Scripting:** Languages like Python or Java for automating test cases.
* **Test Frameworks:**  xUnit (JUnit, TestNG), etc., for structure and reporting.

**6. Non-Functional Testing**

* **Performance Testing:** Load, stress, volume ‚Äì tools like JMeter, LoadRunner.
* **Security Testing:** Identifying vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10), penetration testing approaches.
* **Usability Testing:**  User focus, ensuring software is easy to use.

**7. Beyond Fundamentals**

* **Risk-Based Testing:** Prioritizing based on the likelihood and impact of failures.
* **Mobile App Testing:** Specific challenges and considerations.
* **API Testing:** Testing the 'glue' between systems (Postman, REST Assured)

**Resources**

* **Courses:** Udemy, Coursera, EdX have many testing-specific courses.
* **Certifications:** ISTQB Foundation Level for established best practices.
    * [ISTQB Foundation Level certification syllabus](https://istqb-main-web-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/media/documents/ISTQB_CTFL_Syllabus-v4.0.pdf) 
* **Books:**  
    * "The Art of Software Testing"
    * "Software Testing: A Craftsman's Approach"
