# Introduction

A curated guide to building a successful career in AI testing. Discover essential skills, curated learning resources, and a supportive community to guide your journey.

## Why AI Testing?

AI systems behave differently than traditional software. They learn and adapt, making testing more complex. AI testers ensure these systems are:

* Accurate: Delivering the right outputs and results.
* Robust: Able to handle unexpected inputs and real-world scenarios.
* Secure: Resistant to data manipulation or adversarial attacks.
* Mitigating Risk: Preventing AI failures that could have significant consequences.
* Ensuring Ethical AI: Identifying and addressing potential biases or unintended harm caused by AI systems.
* Building Trust: Verifying that AI models meet quality standards and perform as intended.
